          COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          When it comes to the collection of personal information from children
          under 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts
          parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's
          consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out
          what operators of websites and online services must do to protect
          children's privacy and safety online.
          <br />
          We do not specifically market to children under 13.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Age limits</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal data about or direct
          or target interest-based advertising to anyone under the age of 13 or
          knowingly allow such persons to use our Services. If you are under 13,
          please do not send any data about yourself to us, including your name,
          address, telephone number, or email address. No one under the age of
          13 may provide any personal data. If we learn that we have collected
          personal data about a child under age 13, we will delete that data as
          quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any data from
          or about a child under the age of 13, please contact us.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Fair Information Practices</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy
          law in the United States, and the concepts they include have played a
          significant role in the development of data protection laws around the
          globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how
          they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various
          privacy laws that protect personal information.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-8">
          In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices, we will take
          the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:
          <br />
          - We will notify the users via email within 7 business days.
          <br />- We also agree to the individual redress principle, which
          requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable
          rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to
          the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have
          enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have
          recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or
          prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
